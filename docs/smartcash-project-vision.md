# SmartCash Project Vision

## One-Line Summary
An intelligent backend API that connects to Piraeus Bank accounts to automatically analyze spending, detect patterns, and provide real-time financial insights.

## The Problem
People struggle to understand where their money goes, often discovering too late that they've overspent or forgotten about subscriptions. Traditional banking apps show transactions but don't provide actionable intelligence.

## The Solution
SmartCash automatically:
- Categorizes every transaction to show spending breakdown
- Detects recurring payments and forgotten subscriptions
- Calculates "safe to spend" amounts after accounting for upcoming bills
- Alerts users about unusual spending or low balances
- Provides monthly insights on spending trends

## Core Problems It Solves

### "Where did my money go?"
- Auto-categorizes all transactions
- Shows spending patterns and trends
- Identifies unusual charges

### "Will I have enough money?"
- Predicts cash flow based on recurring patterns
- Alerts before potential overdrafts
- Shows "safe to spend" amount

### "Am I overspending?"
- Real-time budget tracking
- Alerts when approaching limits
- Compares spending to previous months

### "What subscriptions am I paying for?"
- Detects all recurring payments
- Identifies forgotten subscriptions
- Tracks price increases

### "How can I save more?"
- Analyzes spending for saving opportunities
- Suggests optimal saving amounts
- Tracks progress toward goals

## Technical Approach
A production-ready Django REST API that:
- Integrates with Piraeus Bank's API for real-time account data
- Uses PostgreSQL's advanced features for financial calculations
- Processes transactions asynchronously with Celery
- Implements bank-grade security with JWT authentication
- Caches frequently accessed data with Redis

## Target Users
Young professionals in Greece who want to take control of their finances without manual tracking or complex spreadsheets.

## Why This Matters
Shows employers you can build:
- Real-world fintech solutions
- Production-ready APIs with external integrations
- Scalable architecture for financial data
- Practical applications that solve actual problems

## Key Technical Decisions

### Data Architecture
- **Transaction Storage**: Store raw Piraeus data in JSONB for flexibility, with extracted fields for querying
- **Categorization**: Dual approach - rule-based for immediate results, ML for improvement over time
- **Financial Calculations**: Use PostgreSQL window functions for running balances and trends
- **Time-series Data**: Partition transactions by month for query performance

### Security & Privacy
- **No Storage of Bank Credentials**: Only OAuth tokens
- **Encryption at Rest**: Sensitive fields encrypted in database
- **Audit Trail**: Log all financial data access
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies for GDPR compliance

### Performance Considerations
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache account balances, monthly summaries, category mappings
- **Async Processing**: All heavy calculations in background tasks
- **Database Optimization**: Materialized views for analytics, proper indexing
- **API Rate Limiting**: Respect Piraeus limits, implement user-based limits

### Integration Points
- **Piraeus Bank API**: OAuth2 flow, AIS for transactions, webhook support
- **Notification Services**: Email for reports, push for real-time alerts
- **Export Capabilities**: CSV/PDF for tax purposes, JSON API for frontend
- **Future Extensibility**: Designed to support multiple banks

## Success Metrics
- Successfully sync and categorize 100% of transactions
- Generate insights within 2 seconds of request
- Detect 95% of recurring payments accurately
- Process webhooks in under 500ms
- Support 1000+ concurrent users with single instance
